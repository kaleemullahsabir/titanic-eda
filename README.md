# Titanic — Exploratory Data Analysis

**Dataset:** Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster  
**Author:** Kaleem Ullah Sabir  

## 📋 Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to study survival patterns based on passenger features.

## 📂 Files Included
- `titanic_notebook.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full EDA, feature engineering, visualizations, and model training.
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` — Cleaned Titanic dataset after preprocessing.
- `./figures/` — Folder containing **6 high-resolution PNG figures** (barplots, heatmaps, boxplots, correlations).
- `titanic_notebook.html` — Exported HTML version of the notebook for sharing or submission.

## 🔑 Key Findings
- Overall survival rate: **XX%**.
- Females had higher survival (YY%) than males (ZZ%).  
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rate (AA%), third-class the lowest (BB%).  
- Younger passengers and small families showed slightly higher survival.  
- Deck information (when available) correlated with survival.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Place `train.csv` in the same folder.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and run `titanic_notebook.ipynb`.
3. Figures and cleaned CSV will be saved automatically in `./figures/`.
