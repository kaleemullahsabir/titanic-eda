# Titanic — Exploratory Data Analysis

**Dataset:** Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster  
**Author:** Kaleem Ullah Sabir  

## 📋 Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to study survival patterns based on passenger features.

## 📂 Files Included
- `EDA1.ipynb` / `EDA2.ipynb` — Jupyter notebooks with full analysis and visualizations.
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` — Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.
- `./figures/` — Folder with 5–6 high-resolution PNG figures.
- `report.html` — Exported HTML version of the notebook.

## 🔑 Key Findings
- Overall survival rate: **XX%**.
- Females had higher survival (YY%) than males (ZZ%).  
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rate (AA%), third-class the lowest (BB%).  
- Younger passengers and small families showed slightly higher survival.  
- Deck information (when available) correlated with survival.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Place `train.csv` in the same folder.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and run `EDA1.ipynb` or `EDA2.ipynb`.
3. Figures and cleaned CSV will be saved automatically in `./figures/`.
